# Pyramid-Number-Sum

Calculating the sum of numbers in the nth position/row of a pyramid.

## Description

This project calculates the sum of all the numbers in the specified position/row of a pyramid. The pyramid is a triangular pattern where each row contains a sequence of numbers. The position/row number determines the number of elements in that row, and the goal is to find the sum of those numbers.

The program determines the starting number based on whether the position is odd or even, and then calculates the sum using a formula based on the position. It prompts the user to enter the desired position and displays the sum of the numbers in that row.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or download the `pyramid_number_sum.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Enter the row number/position of the pyramid when prompted.
5. The program will display the sum of the numbers in the specified row.
